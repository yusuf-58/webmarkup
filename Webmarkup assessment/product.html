                    <h4>Global story about the product</h4>
                    <p>VAR is an official who assists the referee during a football match and re-evaluates decisions on request using CCTV footage. The video umpire is a fully qualified umpire. 
                        He is in a location outside the field of play and is in contact with the referee via a radio link. There are some football fans who dislike the VAR because of the opinion 
                        from the VAR, but there also benefits with VAR. </p>

                    <h4>What kind of problem does it solve?</h4>
                    <p> The problem that he solve is that de VAR can see what a referee cant see. If anything 
                        happens on the field and the referee can't see it the VAR will interrupt and talk with the referee about a situation, he will be called to a to a monitor so the referee can 
                        rewatch the situation. After that he will make a decision of what will happen next, like it is a foul or it is a red card for the player.</p>

                    <h4>How does the VAR work</h4>
                    <p>Instead of just one person, a team of three people work together to review decisions made by the main referee. They do it by watching the video footage of the situation again 
                        so the main referee can decide of his opinion will change or that it will be the right decision. What the VAR
                        actually doing is assist the referee only in the event of a 'clear and obvious error' or 'serious missed incident'.

                    <h4>Who is using the VAR?</h4>
                    <p>The people who are using this is the referee, and the referee behind the monitors. There is no one else who has the permission to watch the footage or control the footage. 
                        It is even not allowed that the players on the field could watch the footage with the referee, there is a chance that the players stand next to the referee trying to watch 
                        the footage but ended up with a punishment</p>

                    <h4>What can you expect from the service this company is delivering</h4>
                    <p>There is to many things you can expect because of the fact that there are different opinions about the video assistant referee among the fans. The reason is that some fans 
                        think they make the wrong decisions but when the decision is in the advantage of the fans they think that the video assistant referee is the best thing ever. So it is a bit 
                        hard to think what to expect.</p>

                    <h4>Future from this innovation</h4>
                    <p>The future of video assistant referee will have a long future, because the technology in our life right now will be not the same as over 20 years or even more. So that technological 
                        development will also have a effect on the video assistant referee, maybe they will use way more cameras better sensors. Or maybe even find a whole different way for finding a solution 
                        for the decisions of the referee.</p>
