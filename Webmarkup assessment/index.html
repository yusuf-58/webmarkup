                    <h4>VAR (videoassistent)</h4>
                    <p>VAR is an official who assists the referee during a football match and re-evaluates decisions on request using CCTV footage. The video umpire is a fully qualified umpire. 
                         He is in a location outside the field of and is in contact with the referee via a radio link. There are some football fans who dislike the VAR because of the opinion 
                        from the VAR,  but there also benefits with VAR. </p>

                    <h4>Hawk-eye</h4>
                    <p>Hawk-Eye is a computer system used in cricket, tennis and other sports that tracks the trajectory of the ball. It was developed in 2001 by Dr. Paul Hawkins. 
                        Hawk-Eye uses at least six computer-connected television cameras positioned around the athletics or field. The computer reads the images in real time and follows the trajectory 
                        of the ball in each camera. These six different angles are then combined, resulting in an accurate three-dimensional representation of the ball's path that can be viewed in a 
                        virtual reality simulation.</p>
